Exercise 1: Write a program to do the following operations using Thread:
a. Create an user defined Thread class called as “CopyDataThread .java” .
b. This class will be designed to copy the content from one file “source.txt ” to another file “target.txt” and after every 10 characters copied, “10 characters are copied” message will be shown to user.(Keep delay of 5 seconds after every 10 characters read.)
c. Create another class “FileProgram.java” which will create above thread. Pass required File Stream classes to CopyDataThread constructor and implement the above functionality.
Exercise 2: Write a thread program to display timer where timer will get refresh after every 10seconds.( Use Runnable implementation )
